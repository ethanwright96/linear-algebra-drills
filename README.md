# Matrix Multiplication and Inverse Exercises

## Introduction

This set of practice exercises is designed to help you understand matrix multiplication and inverse matrices in linear algebra using Python. Before starting, make sure you have some basic knowledge of matrices and their properties.

## Exercise 1: Matrix Multiplication

Write a Python function that takes two matrices as input and returns their product if the multiplication is possible. Otherwise, it should raise an exception indicating that the matrices cannot be multiplied. Test your function with various matrices.

## Exercise 2: Identity Matrix

Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n x n` identity matrix. An identity matrix is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

## Exercise 3: Scalar Multiplication

Write a Python function that takes a matrix and a scalar as input and returns the result of multiplying the matrix by the scalar.

## Exercise 4: Matrix Transposition

Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and returns its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.

## Exercise 5: Inverse Matrix

Write a Python function that takes a square matrix as input and returns its inverse if it exists. If the matrix is singular (non-invertible), the function should raise an exception indicating that the inverse does not exist.

## Exercise 6: Matrix Inversion Property Test

Write a Python function that tests the property of matrix inversion. Given a square matrix `A`, compute its inverse `A_inv`, and then verify that `A * A_inv` is equal to the identity matrix.

## Exercise 7: Solving Linear Equations

Write a Python function that takes a square matrix `A` and a vector `b` as inputs, and then solves the system of linear equations `Ax = b` using matrix inversion. If the matrix is singular, the function should raise an exception indicating that the system has no unique solution.

## Exercise 8: Matrix Rank

Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and returns its rank. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains.

## Exercise 9: Matrix Determinant

Write a Python function that takes a square matrix as input and computes its determinant using the properties of determinants.

## Exercise 10: Matrix Power

Write a Python function that takes a square matrix and an integer `k` as inputs and computes the matrix raised to the power of `k`.

## Getting Started
